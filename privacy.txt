I agree to the official YNAB OAuth privacy requirements:

	1. A Privacy Policy must be in place for the application that is displayed to users and that includes the following:
		1. An explanation of how the data obtained through the YNAB API will he handled, stored, and secured.
		2. A guarantee that the data obtained through the YNAB API will not unknowingly be passed to any third-party.
	2. The application must not directly request, handle or store any financial account credentials other than an access token obtained directly from a financial institution using OAuth.
	3. In line with the Attribution & Intellectual Property section of the API Terms of Service above, the application and the web address (DNS name) must not include "YNAB" or "You Need A Budget" unless preceded by the word "for".
		Acceptable: "Budget Tools", "Transaction Syncer", "Currency Tools for YNAB".
		Unacceptable: "YNAB Tools", "YNAB Transaction Syncer", "Advanced YNAB".

No data is stored except on the machine from which this library is used. Stored data includes everything sent or received to YNAB, to allow backup/restore functionality. 
No data is transmitted except to YNAB. That data is transmitted via a Python API, ynab_api, which I generated from the official YNAB swagger specs. 
In short, there are no privacy or security implications of this program beyond those of using the official YNAB or storing your own data locally.
